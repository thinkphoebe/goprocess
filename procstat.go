// ProcStat holds all the information available in /proc/:pid/stat with information about the process.  This is used by ps(1).
// It is defined in /usr/src/linux/fs/proc/array.c.
// The fields, in order, with their proper scanf(3) format
// specifiers, are:
type ProcStat struct {
	Pid                 int    // (1) The process ID.
	Comm                string // (2) The filename of the executable, in parentheses.  This is visible whether or not the executable is swapped out.
	State               byte   // (3) One character from the string "RSDZTW" where R is running, S is sleeping in an interruptible wait, D is waiting in uninterruptible disk sleep, Z is zombie, T is traced or stopped (on a signal), and W is paging.
	PPid                int    // (4) The PID of the parent.
	PGrp                int    // (5) The process group ID of the process.
	Session             int    // (6) The session ID of the process.
	TtyNr               int    // (7) The controlling terminal of the process.  (The minor device number is contained in the combination of bits 31 to 20 and 7 to 0; the major device number is in bits 15 to 8.)
	Tpgid               int    // (8) The ID of the foreground process group of the controlling terminal of the process.
	Flags               int64  // (9) The kernel flags word of the process.  For bit meanings, see the PF_* defines in the Linux kernel source file include/linux/sched.h.  Details depend on the kernel version.
	Minflt              int64  // (10) The number of minor faults the process has made which have not required loading a memory page from disk.
	Cminflt             uint64 // (11) The number of minor faults that the process's waited-for children have made.
	Majflt              uint64 // (12) The number of major faults the process has made which have required loading a memory page from disk.
	Cmajflt             uint64 // (13) The number of major faults that the process's waited-for children have made.
	Utime               uint64 // (14) Amount of time that this process has been scheduled in user mode, measured in clock ticks (divide by sysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK)).  This includes guest time, guest_time (time spent running a virtual CPU, see below), so that applications that are not aware of the guest time field do not lose that time from their calculations.
	Stime               uint64 // (15) Amount of time that this process has been scheduled in kernel mode, measured in clock ticks (divide by sysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK)).
	Cutime              int64  // (16) Amount of time that this process's waited-for children have been scheduled in user mode, measured in clock ticks (divide by sysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK)).  (See also times(2).)  This includes guest time, cguest_time (time spent running a virtual CPU, see below).
	Cstime              int64  // (17) Amount of time that this process's waited-for children have been scheduled in kernel mode, measured in clock ticks (divide by sysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK)).
	Priority            int64  // (18) (Explanation for Linux 2.6) For processes running a real-time scheduling policy (policy below; see sched_setscheduler(2)), this is the negated scheduling priority, minus one; that is, a number in the range -2 to -100, corresponding to real-time priorities 1 to 99.  For processes running under a non-real-time scheduling policy, this is the raw nice value (setpriority(2)) as represented in the kernel.  The kernel stores nice values as numbers in the range 0 (high) to 39 (low), corresponding to the user-visible nice range of -20 to 19.  Before Linux 2.6, this was a scaled value based on the scheduler weighting given to this process.
	Nice                int64  // (19) The nice value (see setpriority(2)), a value in the range 19 (low priority) to -20 (high priority).
	NumThreads          int64  // (20) Number of threads in this process (since Linux 2.6).  Before kernel 2.6, this field was hard coded to 0 as a placeholder for an earlier removed field.
	Itrealvalue         int64  // (21) The time in jiffies before the next SIGALRM is sent to the process due to an interval timer.  Since kernel 2.6.17, this field is no longer maintained, and is hard coded as 0.
	Starttime           uint64 // (22) The time the process started after system boot.  In kernels before Linux 2.6, this value was expressed in jiffies.  Since Linux 2.6, the value is expressed in clock ticks (divide by sysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK)).
	Vsize               uint64 // (23) Virtual memory size in bytes.
	Rss                 uint64 // (24) Resident Set Size: number of pages the process has in real memory.  This is just the pages which count toward text, data, or stack space.  This does not include pages which have not been demand-loaded in, or which are swapped out.
	Rsslim              uint64 // (25) Current soft limit in bytes on the rss of the process; see the description of RLIMIT_RSS in getrlimit(2).
	Startcode           uint64 // (26) The address above which program text can run.
	Endcode             uint64 // (27) The address below which program text can run.
	Startstack          uint64 // (28) The address of the start (i.e., bottom) of the stack.
	Kstkesp             uint64 // (29) The current value of ESP (stack pointer), as found in the kernel stack page for the process.
	Kstkeip             uint64 // (30) The current EIP (instruction pointer).
	Signal              uint64 // (31) The bitmap of pending signals, displayed as a decimal number.  Obsolete, because it does not provide information on real-time signals; use /proc/[pid]/status instead.
	Blocked             uint64 // (32) The bitmap of blocked signals, displayed as a decimal number.  Obsolete, because it does not provide information on real-time signals; use /proc/[pid]/status instead.
	Sigignore           uint64 // (33) The bitmap of ignored signals, displayed as a decimal number.  Obsolete, because it does not provide information on real-time signals; use /proc/[pid]/status instead.
	Sigcatch            uint64 // (34) The bitmap of caught signals, displayed as a decimal number.  Obsolete, because it does not provide information on real-time signals; use /proc/[pid]/status instead.
	Wchan               uint64 // (35) This is the "channel" in which the process is waiting.  It is the address of a system call, and can be looked up in a namelist if you need a textual name.  (If you have an up-to-date /etc/psdatabase, then try ps -l to see the WCHAN field in action.)
	Nswap               uint64 // (36) Number of pages swapped (not maintained).
	Cnswap              uint64 // (37) Cumulative nswap for child processes (not maintained).
	ExitSignal          int    // (38) Signal to be sent to parent when we die.
	Processor           int    // (39) CPU number last executed on.
	RtPriority          uint   // (40) Real-time scheduling priority, a number in the range 1 to 99 for processes scheduled under a real-time policy, or 0, for non-real-time processes (see sched_setscheduler(2)).
	Policy              uint   // (41) Scheduling policy (see sched_setscheduler(2)).  Decode using the SCHED_* constants in linux/sched.h.
	DelayacctBlkioTicks uint64 // (42) Aggregated block I/O delays, measured in clock ticks (centiseconds).
	GuestTime           uint64 // (43) Guest time of the process (time spent running a virtual CPU for a guest operating system), measured in clock ticks (divide by sysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK)).
	CguestTime          uint   // (44) Guest time of the process's children, measured in clock ticks (divide by sysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK)).
